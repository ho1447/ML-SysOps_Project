    "* **Canary**: From staging, the service is promoted to a canary environment, where a small fraction of live users test the new version. We monitor for any issues in service performance or infrastructure.\n",
    "* **Production**: After successful evaluation, the model is deployed to the production environment, serving the majority of users. Continuous monitoring ensures that the system maintains optimal performance.\n"

    "\n",
    "After testing the model in staging, itâ€™s time to promote it to the **canary** environment and eventually to **production**. Here's how you can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **Workflow Templates** > **promote-model** > **Submit**.\n",
    "2. In the source environment, select \"staging\" and enter \"canary\" in the target environment.\n",
    "3. Choose the model version from **staging** that you want to promote (this can be obtained from **MLFlow**).\n",
    "4. Hit **Submit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will trigger the **build-container-image.yaml** workflow, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Downloads the model wrapper code from **Git**,\n",
    "* Retrieves the **staging model** from **MLFlow**,\n",
    "* Bundles both together and makes it available in the **canary** environment.\n",

    "You can repeat the same process to promote the model from **canary** to **production**.\n"
